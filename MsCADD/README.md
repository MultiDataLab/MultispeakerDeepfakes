## ðŸŽ§ Dataset Description

- **Total clips**: 2,830 audio conversations  
  - 1,148 **real** human-recorded dialogues  
  - 1,682 **synthetic** conversations generated via TTS

- **Duration**: Each clip is 10â€“22 seconds long.  
- **Speakers per clip**: 2  
- **Speaker composition**:  
  - Maleâ€“Female  
  - Maleâ€“Male  
  - Femaleâ€“Female  

- **Sources**:  
  - Real conversations from the English Conversation Corpus (ICASSP 2022)  
  - Synthetic conversations generated with:  
    - **VITS (Coqui TTS)** â€“ multiple speaker IDs for timbre/accent diversity  
    - **SoundStorm (Google NotebookLM TTS)** â€“ natural back-and-forth exchanges including laughter and conversational nuances

## ðŸ“Š Benchmark Baselines

We provide results for three neural baseline detection models:  
- **LFCC-LCNN** (ASVspoof baseline)  
- **RawNet2** (end-to-end CNN)  
- **Wav2Vec 2.0** (self-supervised transformer)  

Performance metrics include accuracy, F1-score, TPR, and TNR. See our paper for details.
